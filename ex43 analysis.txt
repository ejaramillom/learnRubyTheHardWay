Death
This is when the player dies and should be something funny.
Central Corridor
This is the starting point and has a Gothon already standing there that the players have to defeat with a joke before continuing.
Laser Weapon Armory
This is where the hero gets a neutron bomb to blow up the ship before getting to the escape pod. It has a keypad the hero has to guess the number for.
The Bridge
Another battle scene with a Gothon where the hero places the bomb.
Escape Pod
Where the hero escapes but only after guessing the right escape pod.
